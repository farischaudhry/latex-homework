# homework.cls

A simple, (functionally) unopinionated document class well-suited to homework assignments on mathematics and computer science. Using different fonts, your work has a fresh but professional look. The class provides many useful macros, making it easy to produce beautifully typeset documents.

A [template](main.tex) ([pdf](main.pdf)) is provided, containing some examples. It's also available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/gijss-homework-template/xrhhfgqcfbft) (although often outdated).
